# HolyC PHP
I just hack on this when I'm bored. If anyone wants to join in, feel free.
Eventually this is going to be a NASM Assembler for HolyC, written in PHP for the novelty.

No packages allowed! Everything must be written from scratch 
from the `Collections` to the `NodeTree` and everything in between!
